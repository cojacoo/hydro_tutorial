# Hydrology Tutorial

This is a small set of tutorials in basic hydrologic calculations and modelling using Python. The notebooks shall motivate the use of skripting languages to solve tasks in calculations, data analysis and modelling. It is an optional and voluntary extension of the exercises held at KIT.

All code and data is provided under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License on an "as is" basis. The code is intended as useful but comes without any liability. As the notebooks are for educational purposes, readability of the code is weighted high above sleakness and efficiency.

## 1 Gauges, Discharge and Water Balance

This notebook gives examples to derive rating curves to relate observed discharge (m3/s) to gauged water level (m). The derived functions are applied to data calculating a dynamic water balance of subcatchments of the Attert in Luxembourg.

## 2 Flow Duration and Event Runoff

The second tutorial evaluates subbasins based on flow duration curves (FDC) as rank statistics of discharge behaviour. The FDCs are used to estimate the suitability of river supplied water usage. Moreover, one storm event in the Attert is analysed for runoff concentration and runoff coefficient.

## 4a Event Mitigation and 4b First Simple Hydrological Models

This tutorial illustrates the estimation of a seepage body to mitigate flooding in case of extreme rainfall events. Moreover, a first simple linear store model is presented.
